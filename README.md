# UXDemoApp

This is a UX demo for a PropTech startup to show a design proof of concept to investors for a MVP.

The app was built in around 10 working days, and is primarily designed to showcase the core UX features, therefore the code is not production clean in terms of lint, typescript or functionality and the code is a little messier than I would normally write, but they were a startup and time is money and clean code doesn't get you funded, features do ;)

The App is built for expo. To Run:

setup expo on your machine if you haven't already.

https://expo.io/learn

install the expo client on your device. (Requires SDK V35 compatible app)


yarn install

to update the node modules.

run the app:

expo start

at the command line.

scan the QR Code with the expo app (android) or camera (ios) to load.
